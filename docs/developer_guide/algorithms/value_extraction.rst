General Value Extraction
************************

Overview
========

Value extraction is the process of scanning text for query terms and finding
numeric values associated with those terms. For example, consider the
sentence:

    ``The patient's heart rate was 60 beats per minute.``

It is clear that the value 60 is associated with "heart rate". A value
extractor using this sentence as input should therefore return 60 as the
result for the query "heart rate".

Values can occur either before or after the query terms, since both
variants are acceptable forms of English expression:

 |   ``A 98.6F temperature was measured during the exam.    (before)``
 |   ``A temperature of 98.6F was measured during the exam. (after)``

The *value-follows-query* form is dominant in the text of medical records.
To constrain the scope of the problem and to reduce the chances of error:

    **ClarityNLP assumes that the value FOLLOWS the query terms.**

This assumption does **not** imply anything about the distance between the
query and the value. Sometimes the value immediately follows the term, as
in terse lists of vital signs:

    ``Vitals: Temp 100.2 HR 72 BP 184/56 RR 16 sats 96% on RA``

Other times, in narrative text, one or more words fill the space between
query term and value:

    ``The temperature recorded for the patient at the exam was 98.6F.``

ClarityNLP is able to understand these situations and correctly associate the
value 98.6 with "temperature".

Value Types
-----------

ClarityNLP's value extractor can recognize several different value types:

=================================  ===========================
Value Type                         Example
=================================  ===========================
Nonnegative Integer                0, 3, 42
Nonnegative Floating Point         3.1415, .27, 0.27
Numeric Range                      2-5, 2.3 - 4.6, 2.3 to 4.6
Numeric Range with Matching Units  15 ml to 20 ml
Fraction                           120/80, 120 / 80, 120 /80
Fraction Range                     110/70 - 120/80
=================================  ===========================

Fractions can have arbitrary whitespace on either side of the forward
slash, as some of these examples illustrate. For floating point numbers,
the digit before the decimal point is optional.

Value Relationships
-------------------

ClarityNLP can associate queries and values expressed in many different formats:

=================================  ==========================================================
Format                             Example
=================================  ==========================================================
No space                           ``T98.6``
Whitespace                         ``T 98.6``, ``T    98.6``
Dash                               ``T-98.6``, ``T- 98.6``
Colon                              ``T:98.6``, ``T  :98.6``
Equality                           ``T=98.6``, ``T = 98.6``, ``T  =98.6``, ``T is 98.6``
Approximations                     ``T ~ 98.6``, ``T approx. 98.6``, ``T is ~98.6``
Greater Than or Less Than          ``T > 98.6``, ``T<=98.6``, ``T .lt. 98.6``, ``T gt 98.6``
Narrative                          ``T was greater than 98.6``
=================================  ==========================================================

In general, the amount of whitespace between query and value is arbitrary.

Result Filters
--------------

ClarityNLP filters numerical results by user-specified min and max values.
Any results that fall outside of the interval ``[min, max]`` are discarded.
Any numeric value is accepted if these limits are not specified.

For fractions, the value extractor returns the numerator value by default.
The denominator can be returned instead by use of a runtime argument.

Hypotheticals
-------------

The value extractor attempts to identify hypothetical phrases and to ignore any
values found therein. It uses a simplified version of the *ConText* algorithm
of [1]_ to recognize hypothetical phrases. The "trigger" terms that denote
the start of a hypothetical phrase are: ``in case``, ``call for``, ``should``,
and ``if`` when not preceded by ``know`` and not followed by ``negative``.


Source Code
===========

The source code for the value extractor module is located in
``nlp/algorithms/value_extraction/value_extractor.py``.

Inputs
------

The entry point to the value extractor is the ``run`` function:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   def run(term_string,              # string, comma-separated list of query terms
           sentence,                 # string, the sentence to be processed
           str_minval=None,          # minimum numeric value
           str_maxval=None,          # maximum numeric value
           is_case_sensitive=False,  # set to True to preserve case
           is_denom_only=False)      # set to True to return denoms

If the ``str_minval`` and ``str_maxval`` arguments are omitted, ClarityNLP accepts
any numeric value that it finds for a given query. The other arguments should be
self-explanatory.

Outputs
-------

A JSON array containing these fields for each value found:

================  ==============================================================
Field Name        Explanation
================  ==============================================================
sentence          the sentence from which values were extracted
terms             comma-separated list of query terms
querySuccess      "true" if a value was found, "false" if not
measurementCount  the number of values found
measurements      array of results
================  ==============================================================

Each result in the measurements array contains these fields:

================  ==============================================================
Field Name        Explanation
================  ==============================================================
text              matching text containing query and value
start             offset of the first character in the matching text
end               offset of the final character in the matching text plus 1
condition         a string expressing the relation between query and value:
                  APPROX, LESS_THAN, LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL, GREATER_THAN,
                  GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL, EQUAL, RANGE, FRACTION_RANGE
matchingTerm      the query term associated with this value
x                 matching value
y                 matching value (only for ranges)
minValue          minimum value of x and y
maxValue          maximum value of x and y
================  ==============================================================

All JSON results will have an identical number of fields. Any fields that are
not valid for a given result will have a value of EMPTY_FIELD and should be
ignored.


Algorithm
=========

The value extractor does its work in two stages. The first stage consists of
preprocessing operations and the second stage consists of the actual value
extraction operations.

In the preprocessing stage, the term list is split on commas, whitespace is
removed, and the terms and sentence are converted to lowercase for
case-insensitive matches. The input string is scanned for size measurements
and date expressions; any that are found are erased, since ClarityNLP provides
other modules for extracting these. A few other string cleanup operations are
also performed in the preprocessing stage.

After preprocessing, the value extractor constructs a query regular expression
for each of the search terms. It then applies a set of regular expressions to
the sentence, each of which is capable of recognizing a particular value type
from the preceding tables. Overlapping matches are resolved by keeping the
longest matching text at any position in the string.

If a match is found, the numeric values are extracted, and filters for min
and max values and hypotheticals applied. If the values survive the filtering
operations, a python namedtuple containing all relevant fields is created.
All such namedtuples are appended to a list during processing. 

When no more regex matches can be found, the list of result namedtuples is
converted to JSON and returned to the caller.

Users can expect the value extractor to return the first valid numeric result
following a query term.
