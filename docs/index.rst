ClarityNLP
==========

`ClarityNLP <https://github.com/ClarityNLP/ClarityNLP>`_ is an "interoperable
NLP" platform developed to streamline analysis of unstructured clinical text.
The platform accelerates review of medical charts to extract data and identify
patients for a wide variety of purposes, including research, clinical care,
and quality metrics.  ClarityNLP combines NLP techniques and libraries with a
powerful query language, NLPQL, that lets you create and deploy NLP jobs
quickly without a lot of custom configuration.
