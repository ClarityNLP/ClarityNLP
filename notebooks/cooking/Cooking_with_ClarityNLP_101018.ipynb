The MIMIC-III Critical Care Database is data set containing information about ICU patients who stayed at the Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital between 2001 and 2012. MIMIC-III has multiple types of clinical observational data, including text. It has been de-identified for research use. Unlike most public clinical data sets, unstructured text is available in the MIMIC-III database, making it suitable for our research"

    "\n",
    "The initial focus of OHDSI phenotypes has been primarily structured data such as diagnosis codes, procedure codes, drug codes and so forth. More recently the OMOP common data model has introduced an NLP table which offers the ability to incorporate more information from unstructured sources. But an important gap that remains is the ability to develop phenotypes that dynamically incorporate both structured and unstructured data in a reproducible and shareable format. In this cooking session, we would like to demonstrate some of the mechanisms by which ClarityNLP can be combined with OHDSI to create more robust cohort definitions and convert data from unstructured to structured form."
