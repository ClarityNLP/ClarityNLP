We'll show how you can enhance vocabulary in ClarityNLP by using the OMOP vocabulary, how you can build more complete phenotypes using both structured and unstructured data, and how to export ClarityNLP results back to your OMOP database."

The MIMIC-III Critical Care Database is data set containing information about ICU patients who stayed at the Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital between 2001 and 2012. MIMIC-III has multiple types of clinical observational data, including text. It has been de-identified for research use. Unlike most public clinical data sets, unstructured text is available in the MIMIC-III database, making it suitable for our research"
