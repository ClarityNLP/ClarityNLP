For other details on installing and using ClarityNLP, please see our [documentation](https://claritynlp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

You can ingest data from various sources (eg. flat files, relational databases, APIs, etc) and of various types (eg. txt, doc, pdf, etc). Today we will cover one of the most common ingestion patterns-- bringing in data from a CSV.  ClarityNLP has a user interface to support CSV ingestion.  In a typical instance, this will be located at `localhost:6543/csv`."

    "Sometimes we don't want to look for mentions of a concept in just any document, but rather only want to look within certain types of documents.  With ClarityNLP, we can extensively control for the types on documents in which we perform any  algorithm.  A group of documents is referred to in NLPQL as a `documentset`. There are four modifiers that can be used in creating document sets:\n",

    "\n",
    "When documents are ingested into ClarityNLP, you have the option to assign a report type.  For clinical documents, this is typically something like Discharge Summary, Head CT WWO Contrast, Colonoscopy Report, etc.  Clarity has a convenient function `createReportTypeList` for building a document set based on report type.  Here is an example:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***Report Tag***\n",
    "\n",
    "In our research looking at multiple health systems, we found thousands of different report type names.  Such diversity makes it challenging to create phenotypes that can be applied across diverse settings.  To address this, ClarityNLP embeds a Report Type tagging system that facilitates linking report types to the LOINC / RadLex document ontology.  This enables creation of more standardized NLPQL code.  We will discuss report tagging in more detail in a future *Cooking with ClarityNLP* session.\n",

    "Filter queries are a powerful function that will create a apply a filtering function to the documents you have already selected.  These can include dynamic fields added at ingestion time or standard ClarityNLP document fields. See [Solr query documentation](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_4/query-syntax-and-parsing.html) for details.\n",

    "### 1.4 Cooking Special: Finding Gleason Scores\n",
    "Clues to the severity of a prostate tumor can be obtained from a needle biopsy and examination of the tissue under a microscope. Pathologists have developed a numerical scoring system for classifying the microscopic tissue morphology. This score, called the Gleason score, is an important factor in determining the stage of the cancer and the patient's overall prognosis. In this example we will develop a custom task for extracting Gleason scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4.1 Gleason Score Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop a custom Gleason score extractor we first need to investigate how these scores are actually reported in medical records. By searching for the term 'Gleason' in a corpus of prostate-related health data you will find considerable variation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gleason score 7\n",
    "* Gleasons score 7 (3+4)\n",
    "* Gleason's score 3 + 4 = 7/10\n",
    "* Gleason pattern of 3+4\n",
    "* Gleasons 5\n",
    "* Gleason five\n",
    "* Gleason's 3 + 3\n",
    "* Gleason grade is 4+\n",
    "* etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example, the value 7 is the overall score, which consists of the sum of two other components. Sometimes these components are listed in the form `i+j`, as in the second example, sometimes not. Sometimes only the components are listed and the overall score is omitted, as in the fourth example. Whether listed or not, the value of each component ranges from 1 to 5 inclusive, which means that the total Gleason score has a minimum value of 2 and a maximum value of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "These forms and others that we observed all fit this generic pattern: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gleason text string: `Gleason`, `Gleason's`, `Gleasons`, ...\n",
    "2. (optional) designator text string: `score`, `pattern`, `grade`, possibly followed by \"is\" or \"of\"\n",
    "3. (optional) score, either numeric or text\n",
    "4. (optional) two-part component values, possibly parenthesized\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression for recognizing these forms is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "str_gleason  = r'Gleason(\\'?s)?\\s*'\n",
    "str_desig    = r'(score|sum|grade|pattern)(\\s+(is|of))?'\n",
    "\n",
    "# accept a score in digits under these circumstances:\n",
    "#     digit not followed by a '+', e.g. 'Gleason score 6'\n",
    "#     digit followed by '+' but no digit after, e.g. 'Gleason score 3+'\n",
    "# constructs such as Gleason score 3+3 captured in two-part expression below\n",
    "str_score = r'(?P<score>(\\d+(?!\\+)(?!\\s\\+)|\\d+(?=\\+(?!\\d))|'             +\\\n",
    "            r'two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine|ten))'\n",
    "\n",
    "# parens are optional, space surrounding the '+' varies\n",
    "str_two_part = r'((\\(\\s*)?(?P<first_num>\\d+)\\s*\\+\\s*(?P<second_num>\\d+)' +\\\n",
    "               r'(\\s*\\))?)?'\n",
    "\n",
    "# combine all strings\n",
    "str_total = str_gleason + r'(' + str_desig + r'\\s*)?'                    +\\\n",
    "             r'(' + str_score + r'\\s*)?' + str_two_part\n",
    "             \n",
    "# final Gleason regex\n",
    "regex_gleason = re.compile(str_total, re.IGNORECASE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Named capture groups are used in the regex to extract the score and each component, if present.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4.2 Extraction of the Gleason Score from Sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "This regex, along with some additional logic, can be used to recognize and extract Gleason scores from sentences. An outline of the process is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attempt a regex match on the current sentence.\n",
    "* If match, extract all named capture groups that exist.\n",
    "* Convert captured values from string to int.\n",
    "* Check captured values and make sure they fall within expected ranges.\n",
