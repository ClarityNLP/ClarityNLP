    "### 1.1 The FDA Adverse Drug Event Evaluation Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team is currently working on a submission to the [FDA Adverse Drug Event Evaluation Challenge](https://sites.mitre.org/adeeval/). This challenge requires participating teams to ingest a set of drug labels (in XML format), parse these labels to detect and classify adverse events, and output a set of labels indicating the location, class, and associated [MedDRA](https://www.meddra.org/) information for each positive occurrence of an adverse event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we'll break down some of the components of our drug label evaluation strategy to show how you can use components of the ClarityNLP pipeline (specifically, a custom task, and our chart review GUI-based tool) to detect and classify (a subset of) adverse event mentions when they appear in drug labels and/or patient notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The Challenge Training Dataset\n",
    "The FDA challenge training dataset contains text from 100 drug labels, stored in XML format. Each drug label is mapped to a series of ground-truth labels; for the sake of clarity, we will continue to distinguish between **drug** labels and **ground-truth** labels. Each ground-truth label corresponds to an adverse event associated with the drug in question (though there are several possible ways that this relationship may manifest itself), and contains the following fields:\n",

    "There are several reasons that the FDA may consider an adverse event to be (or not be) of interest to the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE). The unique set of reasons, along with their definitions and counts within the FDA training dataset, appear in the table that is generated below:"

This will allow us to identify patterns at a more generic level (since we'll be working with the finite set of {\"type\"||\"reasons\"} rather than the more specific set of underlying adverse events, which are linked to medDRA terms within the ground-truth labels. \n",
