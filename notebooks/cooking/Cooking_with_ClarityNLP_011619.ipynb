    "### 1.1 The FDA Adverse Drug Event Evaluation Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team is currently working on a submission to the [FDA Adverse Drug Event Evaluation Challenge](https://sites.mitre.org/adeeval/). This challenge requires participating teams to ingest a set of drug labels (in XML format), parse these labels to detect and classify adverse events, and output a set of labels indicating the location, class, and associated [MedDRA](https://www.meddra.org/) information for each positive occurrence of an adverse event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we'll break down some of the components of our drug label evaluation strategy to show how you can use components of the ClarityNLP pipeline (specifically, a custom task, and our chart review GUI-based tool) to detect and classify (a subset of) adverse event mentions when they appear in drug labels and/or patient notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The Challenge Training Dataset\n",
    "The FDA challenge training dataset contains text from 100 drug labels, stored in XML format. Each drug label is mapped to a series of ground-truth labels; for the sake of clarity, we will continue to distinguish between **drug** labels and **ground-truth** labels. Each ground-truth label corresponds to an adverse event associated with the drug in question (though there are several possible ways that this relationship may manifest itself), and contains the following fields:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Adverse Event Categories\n",
    "There are several reasons that the FDA may consider an adverse event to be (or not be) of interest to the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE). The unique set of reasons, along with their definitions and counts within the FDA training dataset, appear in the table that is generated below:"

    "Looking at the table above, it's clear that the majority of labeled adverse events fall into a few categories: specifically: (1) adverse events that are mentioned in the instructions in a hypothetical context; (2) general terms, which are too broad to be useful; (3) indications (e.g., clinical symptom(s) for which using the drug in question would be appropriate; and (4) complications, which might occur as the result of an AE, but are not adverse events per se.\n",

    "### 2.1 Generation of Sentence-Level Labels\n",
    "In order to build a rules-based model for detecting/classifying sentences with respect to ground-truth labels, we must first make the provided XML labels into a sentence-level feature matrix that can be used to assess model performance on sentences that do and do not contain each of our ground-truth labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step in this direction was to parse the original XML drug label documents, find the adverse events within the text (using the section-level offsets provided as part of the ground-truth labels), and replace each adverse event with the concatenation of the \"type\"||\"reason\" fields. This will allow us to identify patterns at a more generic level (since we'll be working with the finite set of {\"type\"||\"reasons\"} rather than the more specific set of underlying adverse events, which are linked to medDRA terms within the ground-truth labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "The functions that appear below represent the next step in the process, and serve to generate a sentence-level feature matrix, such that each sentence in each drug label document represents a row, and each possible \"type\"||\"reason\" ground-truth label represents a Boolean-valued column. \n"

Our hope is that these tools can help us to discover latent pattern(s) that we can use to develop a sentence-level Boolean classifier that will offer improved performance and efficiency relative to the status quo. We've divided up this part so that each ground-truth label gets its own subsection, as some of the rules we'll develop are label-specific. \n",

    "### Bucket C: Negation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rule Generation via Dependency Parse Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the negation bucket, we investigate dependency parsing as a possible method for generating rules. Given the \"messy\" nature of our example texts this is generally **not** the preferred method to follow. If, however, you happen have a problem with well-formed, grammatically correct sentences, dependency parse methods can be quite powerful. So we present the methods below mainly to whet your appetite.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **dependency parse** provides part of speech tags for each word as well as dependency information **encoded in tree form**. To illustrate, here is a diagram of a dependency parse of the sentence \"The girl has a flower in her hair.\":\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=./assets/displacy_girl_flower.png>\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram was generated with spaCy’s display tool [displacy](https://explosion.ai/demos/displacy). The part of speech tags appear underneath each word. In addition to NOUN, VERB, and ADJ, we also see DET (determiner) and ADP (preposition). Documentation on spaCy’s annotation scheme can be found [here](https://spacy.io/api/annotation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The arrows represent a child-parent relationship, with the child being at the “arrow” end and the the parent at the other end. **The word at the arrow end modifies the word at the other end.** Thus the word \"The\" modifies \"girl\", since the first arrow starts at the word \"girl\" and points to the word \"The\". The label on the arrow indicates the nature of the parent-child relationship. For the “girl-The” arrow, the \"det\" label on the arrow indicates that the word \"The\" is a determiner that modifies \"girl\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The subject of the verb \"has\" is the word \"girl\", as indicated by the nsubj (nominal subject) label on the second arrow. The direct object of the verb is the noun \"flower\", as the arrow labeled dobj shows. The direct object has a DET modifer \"a\", similarly to the DET modifier for the word \"girl\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A prepositional phrase \"in her hair\" follows the direct object, as the two arrows labeled prep (prepositional modifier) and pobj (object of preposition) indicate. The object of the preposition \"in\" is the noun \"hair\", which has a possessional modifier \"her\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Considered in its entirety, this depencency parse comprises a tree rooted at the verb \"has\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus a dependency parse allows one to determine the nature of the relationships between the various components of a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will illustrate dependency parse techniques by developing a set of rules for phrases such as:\n",
    "- no cases of X were reported ...\n",
    "- no X occurred in any of the ...\n",
    "- no evidence of X or X was seen...\n",
    "- no evidence of serious X was detected in ...\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we want to find phrases that start with \"no\" followed by one or more X tokens with possible intervening words and modifiers, followed by a verb. Here the symbol X is the token that our rules will try to find. Our methods will be successful if, given an input sentence, we can find the X in phrases of this nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we go about finding X with a dependency parse tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must make some realistic concessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long run-on sentences containing medical jargon are difficult for NLP tools to process. Depencency parses for such sentences are generally meaningless. We have accordingly confined our attention to the shorter sentences in our data set. So we will illustrate dependency parse methods on sentences containing **a maximum of 16 words**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **algorithm** we ultimately implemented is below: \n",
    "- Find the ROOT token of the dependency parse (the root of the parse tree).\n",
    "- If the ROOT token has any modifiers, extract all modifier tokens. \n",
    "- Find all nouns in the list of modifier tokens.\n",
    "- For each noun modifier, get the prepositional phrases that modify it, if any. Also get any conjunction-linked nouns.\n",
    "- If any prepositional phrases were found, return the object of the preposition as the target token.\n",
    "- If any conjunction-linked nouns were found, return the original noun token and the linked noun token as the targets.\n",
    "- The presence of a target indicates classification as 1; absence of target token(s) indicates classification as 0.\n",
